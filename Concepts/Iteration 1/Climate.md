### Climate Interaction/Balance
- This Value Stores Information about how your city Influences the Climate
- It also stores every factor that changes this balance
	- Building Material industries 
		- Stuff like Steel and concrete production
	- Imports, based on 
		- their origins on this world
		- your investments in transportation/logistics technology 
	- Traffic and Transportation, based on
		- Materials used for roads built
		- investments in transportation/public transport technology
		- investments in transportation/private transport technology
	- Private Emissions
		- Based on general technology standard and wealth
		- this is hard to influence directly, can be influenced by pushing the market in the correct direction
	- Agriculture and forestry
		- Done right this can have a big impact on reverting the errors of the previous generations as well as your own
		- Done wrong this can ruin a lot
		- Even though stakes are high, it should be easy to determine wether an action will have positive or negative impact
		- This can be influenced by genetic engineering technology, to change efficiency of crops in the desired direction
	- Waste
		- through overproduction in many industries we have high waste production
		- by subsidies for recyclability  and repairability
	- Energy Production
		- Different Energy sources provide different amounts of energy, waste and emissions
			- usual green sources (photovoltaics, wind power)
			- fossile / flammable fuel (coal, oil, hydrogen)
			- nuclear power (fusion, fission)
	- Architecture 
		- More reliable architecture can minimize your need for building materials
		- intelligent building design can minimize energy consumption via i.e. heating/cooling
