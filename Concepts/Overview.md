Overview: "Expanding Horizons" is a single-player futuristic city-building and management simulation game, where you take on the role of a company manager responsible for constructing expandable habitats for living, working, and trade. As the game progresses, you'll gradually build habitats around Earth, Mars, and Jupiter, establishing bases on Earth, Mars, and Callisto, a moon of Jupiter.

Features:

1. Habitat Construction: Manage the construction and expansion of habitats in various locations. Begin with a small base on Earth and gradually unlock the ability to build habitats on Mars and Callisto. Design and customize the habitats according to the specific needs of each location, considering factors such as resource availability, environment, and population requirements.
    
2. Resource Management: Balance resource extraction, allocation, and consumption. Establish resource mining operations on each celestial body to gather essential materials for habitat construction and maintenance. Manage resources like water, oxygen, food, energy, and construction materials to ensure the survival and growth of the habitats.
    
3. Population Management: Attract and accommodate a diverse population within the habitats. Different people will have varying skill sets and needs. Manage the population's well-being, including their housing, healthcare, education, and entertainment, to ensure a harmonious and productive society.
    
4. Research and Development: Invest in research projects to unlock new technologies and advancements. Research can lead to improved resource extraction techniques, more efficient energy sources, advanced construction methods, and innovative solutions to environmental challenges. New discoveries will enhance the growth and sustainability of your habitats.
    
5. Trade and Economy: Establish trade routes between the habitats and Earth, Mars, and Callisto. Utilize transport systems to exchange resources, commodities, and technology. Develop a robust economy by setting prices, managing supply and demand, and exploring new trade opportunities. Expand your company's influence by establishing profitable trade partnerships with other factions or colonies.
    
6. Events and Challenges: Encounter various events and challenges, including natural disasters, equipment malfunctions, or social conflicts. Adapt your strategies and allocate resources to mitigate the effects of these events and ensure the survival and growth of your habitats.
    
7. Expandable Structures: Emphasize the concept of expandable habitats. Allow players to construct modular structures that can be expanded and upgraded over time. As the population and requirements increase, adapt the habitats to accommodate new needs, such as additional living quarters, research facilities, recreational areas, and industrial zones.
    
8. Technology Tree: Implement a technology tree that organizes research options and unlocks new features progressively. Players can choose different research paths, focusing on specific aspects like sustainability, exploration, or advanced infrastructure. Unlocking higher-tier technologies will provide unique benefits and unlock new building options.
    
9. Mission Objectives: Provide a series of mission objectives and milestones to guide players through the game's progression. These objectives can include establishing a self-sustaining habitat on each celestial body, reaching a specific population target, or achieving certain technological advancements. Completing objectives will unlock new locations, resources, and challenges.
    
10. Progression and Unlockables: Reward players with experience points, in-game currency, and unlockable content as they achieve milestones and complete objectives. Unlock additional building options, research projects, and special features to enhance gameplay depth and replayability.
