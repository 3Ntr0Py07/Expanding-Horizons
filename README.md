##### Documentation
The Documentation for the architecture will be found in this repository under the eponymous folder. You might also find a version of concepts/ideas there, but they won't always be up to date. 

All documentation will be written in markdown files. I or some of my kind co-developers will create these markdown files in obsidian, specifically using the internal linking operations and possibly some plugin syntax (if this is the case there will be a list of these used plugins). So be aware that you may not be able to view all the features of the documentation.

If you want to correct something in the documentation or want to add ideas to the collection (of probably not implemented) features, feel free to contact me by opening an issue, or contact me via Discord. Depending on the size of the community I may create a dedicated EcoVille Discord-server, a future reader may find an invite link [here](http://httpstat.us/501)
