##### Releases
There are no releases as of now. 
Releases will might found on following platforms:
- [Steam](http://httpstat.us/501)
- [Itch.io](http://httpstat.us/501)
- [Google Drive - Windows](http://httpstat.us/501)
- [Google Drive - Linux](http://httpstat.us/501)
- [Google Drive - Mac OS](http://httpstat.us/501) (This one depends on wether there will ever exist a Mac OS version)
- [Pirate Bay](http://httpstat.us/501) (This sounds really fishy, but for those who want anonymity it might be a good option. This is also to prevent dangerous copies on Pirate Bay)

If you want me to publish to any other Platform you may contact me about it.

##### Documentation
The Documentation for the architecture will be found in this repository under the eponymous folder. You might also find a version of concepts/ideas there, but they won't always be up to date. 

All documentation will be written in markdown files. I or some of my kind co-developers will create these markdown files in obsidian, specifically using the internal linking operations and possibly some plugin syntax (if this is the case there will be a list of these used plugins). So be aware that you may not be able to view all the features of the documentation.

##### Contact
Feel free to contact me by opening an issue, or contact me via Discord. Depending on the size of the community I may create a dedicated "Expanding Horizons" Discord-server, a future reader may find an invite link [here](http://httpstat.us/501) . Be aware that with hopefully growing size of the repository it will become harder for me to read all messages, as I am not reading messages already. And please only contact me for serious requests, I love humor, but i am already foreseeing an overfilled mailbox which is not really funny (at least for me).

##### Warnings
- Anything in this Repository is subject to change. 
- I might mess up Branches, so the safest way to get working releases is when i have made a working Baseline that will be published on Steam.
- This repository will not include assets, as i do not want that heavy data here. /s But seriously, GitHub has data limits and I do not plan to pay just to upload Gigabytes of Assets.
